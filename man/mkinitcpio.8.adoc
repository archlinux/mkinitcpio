== Name

mkinitcpio - Create an initial ramdisk environment

== Synopsis

_mkinitcpio_ [options]

== Description

Creates an initial ramdisk environment for booting the Linux kernel. The
initial ramdisk is in essence a very small environment (early userspace) which
loads various kernel modules and sets up necessary things before handing over
control to init. This makes it possible to have, for example, encrypted root
file systems and root file systems on a software RAID array. mkinitcpio allows
for easy extension with custom hooks, has autodetection at runtime, and many
other features.

== Options

*-A*, *--addhooks* _hooks_::
    Add the additional _hooks_ to the image. These will be processed in order
    after all other hooks from the config file. Multiple hooks should be
    comma-separated. This option can be specified multiple times.

*-c*, *--config* _config_::
    Use _config_ file to generate the ramdisk. Default: _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.conf_.
    If specified, drop-in files in _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.conf.d_ will be ignored.

*-d*, *--generatedir* _directory_::
    Set _directory_ as the location where the initramfs is built. This might be
    useful to generate a shutdown ramfs in _/run/initramfs/_.

*-D*, *--hookdir* _directory_::
    Set _directory_ as the location where hooks will be searched for when
    generating the image.

*-g*, *--generate* _filename_::
    Generate a CPIO image as _filename_. Default: no; this means nothing will be
    written to the file system unless this option is specified.

*-H*, *--hookhelp* _hookname_::
    Output help for hookname _hookname_.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Output a short overview of available command-line switches.

*-k*, *--kernel* _kernelversion_::
    Use _kernelversion_, instead of the current running kernel. This may be a
    path to a kernel image (only supported for x86-based architectures), a
    specific kernel version or the special keyword _none_. In the latter case,
    no kernel modules are added to the image.

*-L*, *--listhooks*::
    List all available hooks.

*-M*, *--automods*::
    Display modules found via autodetection. mkinitcpio will automatically try
    to determine which kernel modules are needed to start your computer. This
    option lists which modules were detected.

*-n*, *--nocolor*::
    Disable color output.
    
*--nopost*::
    Do not run post hooks. 

*-U*, *--uki* _filename_::
    Generate a unified kernel image as _filename_. If a CPIO image is
    successfully built, it will be used to generate a unified kernel image for
    UEFI booting. This combines the initramfs, the kernel, and the kernel
    cmdline into one executable. This is useful for boot chain integrity where
    the file is signed. Default: no.
    For a list of relevant options see _Options for unified kernel image_ below.

*-P*, *--allpresets*::
    Process all presets contained in _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.d_. See the *-p* option
    for more detail about presets.

*-p*, *--preset* _preset_::
    Build initramfs image(s) according to specified _preset_. This may be a file
    in _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.d_ (without the .preset extension) or a full, absolute
    path to a file. This option may be specified multiple times to process
    multiple presets.

*-R*, *--remove*::
    Remove initramfs image(s) generated by the specified preset(s).
    If used in combination with *-P*|*--allpresets*, removes the images for all
    presets. This option can only be used with either *-p*|*--presets* or
    *-P*|*--allpresets*.

*-r*, *--moduleroot* _root_::
    Specifies the root directory to find modules in, defaulting to _/_.

*-S*, *--skiphooks* _hooks_::
    Skip _hooks_ when generating the image. Multiple hooks should be
    comma-separated. This option can be specified multiple times.

*-s*, *--save*::
    Saves the build directory for the initial ramdisk. Default: no; This means
    the directory will not be retained if this option is not specified. Useful
    for debugging purposes.

*-t*, *--builddir* _tmpdir_::
    Use _tmpdir_ as the temporary build directory instead of _/tmp_. _tmpdir_
    must exist. The _TMPDIR_ environment variable is also honored to set this
    location, but the command line option will take precedence.

*-V*, *--version*::
    Display version information.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
    Verbose output. Outputs more information about what is happening during
    creation of the ramdisk.

*-z*, *--compress* _compress_::
    Override the compression method with the _compress_ program.

== Options for unified kernel image

*--cmdline* _filename_::
    Use kernel command line with unified kernel image. If none is specified,
    try one of the files _/etc/kernel/cmdline_, _/usr/lib/kernel/cmdline_
    or _/proc/cmdline_.

*--no-cmdline*::
    Omit embedding a kernel command line string in the unified kernel image.
    Kernel command line options will need to be passed via the kernel command
    line.
    Overrides the *--cmdline* option.

*--splash* _filename_::
    UEFI executables can show a bitmap file on boot.

*--uefistub* _filename_::
    UEFI stub image used for unified kernel image generation. Has no effect
    if _ukify_ is being used.
    Default: Attempts to look for a systemd-boot or gummiboot
    stub loader.

*--ukiconfig* _filename_::
    Configuration file to pass to _ukify_. If none is specified, try one of the
    files  _/etc/kernel/uki.conf_ or _/usr/lib/kernel/uki.conf_. If neither of
    those exists, _ukify_ will use its internal default.

*--no-ukify*::
    Do not use _ukify_ to build UKIs even if it is available. This is not
    recommended.

*--kernelimage* _filename_::
    Include a kernel image for the unified kernel image. Default: one of
    _/lib/modules/${KERNELVERSION}/vmlinuz_, _/lib/modules/${KERNELVERSION}/vmlinux_,
    _/boot/vmlinuz-${KERNELVERSION}_, _/boot/vmlinux-${KERNELVERSION}_,
    _/boot/vmlinuz-linux_, or _/boot/vmlinux-linux_.

*--osrelease* _filename_::
    Include a os-release file for the unified kernel image.
    Default: _/etc/os-release_ or _/usr/lib/os-release_.

== About presets

A preset is a pre-defined definition on how to create an initial ramdisk.
Instead of specifying the configuration file and which output file, every time
you generate a new initial ramdisk, you define a preset and use the *-p* switch
to generate an initial ramdisk according to your preset.

Typically, presets are files located in _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.d_ with the extension
_.preset_, e.g. _@SYSCONFDIR@/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset_ for the *linux* preset.
It is possible to use files in other locations, too. Then the path to this
file needs to be specified.

Presets files are shell scripts that get sourced by mkinitcpio and the following
variables will influence its behavior.

Note, that mkinitcpio calls itself for each preset and passes the options
defined in the preset file file via command line arguments. Those are mentioned
in the description of the options below, so refer to the manual of the command
line arguments for more information about a particular option.

*PRESETS*::
    An array of preset names defined in this file. These names will be
    used as prefix to other options to provide preset-specific options.
    For example, if a
    _PRESET=(pass:['custom'])_ is given, then the image is specified via
    _custom_image=pass:['/boot/custom.img']_.

*<preset>_kver* (defaults to value of *ALL_kver* -- one of the two is *required*)::
    Specify the Kernel version (via *-k* in mkinitcpio).

*<preset>_config* (defaults to value of *ALL_config* -- one of the two is *required*)::
    Path to the configuration file (passed via *-c* to mkinitcpio).

*<preset>_uki* (one of *<preset>_uki* and *<preset>_image* is *required*)::
    Output file path for a unified kernel image (passed via *-U* to mkinitcpio).

*<preset>_image* (one of *<preset>_uki* and *<preset>_image* is *required*)::
    Output file path for the generated image (passed via *-g* to mkinitcpio).

*<preset>_cmdline* (defaults to value of *ALL_cmdline*)::
    Path to the kernel command line file (passed via *--cmdline* to mkinitcpio).
    This option is only used when generating unified kernel images.

*<preset>_splash* (defaults to value of *ALL_splash*)::
    Path to the splash image file (passed via *--splash* to mkinitcpio).
    This option is only used when generating unified kernel images.

*<preset>_options*::
    Further command line arguments to pass to mkinitcpio as a string or array.
    They will get appended at the end of the call to mkinitcpio (after all the
    options mentioned above), so this can be used to overwrite options (for
    example pass a *-S* _hook_ here to skip a hook).

== About install hooks

Install hooks are bash scripts which are sourced during mkinitcpio runtime in
order to add modules, binaries, and other files to the image. A variety of
functions exist to facilitate this.

*add_module* _modname_::
    Adds the module specified by _modname_ to the image. Dependencies are
    derived and added automatically.

*add_binary* _binary_ [ _destination_ ] [ _mode_ ]::
    Adds a binary to the image. The argument _binary_ need not be an absolute
    path and, if needed, a lookup will be performed. If the binary is a
    dynamically linked ELF binary, dependencies will be automatically added. If
    it is a symlink, both the symlink and the target binary will be added.
    Optionally, a destination within the initramfs image as well as a file mode
    can be specified. By default, the destination and mode be taken from the
    source derived from _binary_.

*add_file* _path_ [ _destination_ ] [ _mode_ ]::
    Adds a file and any needed parent directories to the image. If it is a
    symlink, both the symlink and the target file will be added. Optionally, a
    destination within the initramfs image as well as a file mode can be
    specified. By default, the destination and mode will be taken from the
    source and mode of the file specified by the _path_.

*add_file_early* _path_ [ _destination_ ] [ _mode_ ]::
    Adds a file and any needed parent directories to the early uncompressed
    image. Works the same way as *add_file*.

*add_dir* _path_::
    Adds a directory and its parents to the image.

*add_dir_early* _path_::
    Adds a directory and its parents to the early uncompressed image. Works the
    same way as *add_dir*.

*add_full_dir* _directory_ [ _glob_ ] [ _strip_prefix_ ]::
    Recursively adds a directory to the image by walking the given path and
    calling *add_file*, *add_dir*, and *add_symlink* accordingly. This function
    will not follow symlinks, nor will it add the targets of symlinks.
     +
    If the _glob_ argument is passed, only files and symlinks matching this glob
    will be added.
     +
    If the _strip_prefix_ argument is passed, it will be used to strip the
    destination path (path in the initramfs image) from the prefix specified by
    the _strip_prefix_ argument. This can be useful when writing rootfs-overlay
    hooks.

*add_symlink* _path_ [ _link-target_ ]::
    Adds a symlink to the image at the specified _path_, optionally pointing to
    the specified _link-target_. If the _link-target_ is not provided, it is
    assumed that this symlink exists in the real file system, and the target
    will be read using *readlink*(1). There is no checking done to ensure that
    the target of the symlink exists, and symlinks will not be followed
    recursively.

*add_all_modules* [ *-f* _filter_ ] _pattern_::
    Adds modules to the image, without regard for the autodetect whitelist.
    _pattern_ should be a subdirectory within the kernel tree describing a
    subset of modules to be included. Further refinement can be provided via
    the *-f* flag with an extended regular expression.

*add_checked_modules* [ *-f* _filter_ ] _pattern_::
    Similar to *add_all_modules* with the constraint that only modules matching
    the whitelist generated by the autodetect hook will be added to the image.
    If the autodetect hook is not present in the image, this function is
    identical to *add_all_modules*.

*add_runscript* _scriptname_::
    Adds a runtime hook to the image, which is a busybox ash compatible shell
    script. The name of the script is guaranteed to match the name of the hook
    the script is called from.

*add_udev_rule* _rule-file_::
    Adds a udev rule to the image. Dependencies on binaries will be discovered
    and added. The argument can be a rule file name (discovered from well known
    udev paths) or an absolute path.

*add_all_modules_from_symbol* _symbol_ _paths_::
    Adds modules from the _paths_ directories containing the _symbol_ to the
    image.

*add_checked_modules_from_symbol* _symbol_ _paths_::
    Similar to *add_all_modules_from_symbol* with the constraint that only
    modules matching the whitelist generated by the autodetect hook will be
    added to the image. If the autodetect hook is not present in the image, this
    function is identical to *add_all_modules_from_symbol*.

== About early CPIO

mkinitcpio has support for early CPIO. These are uncompressed CPIO archives
prepended to the main compressed CPIO archive. They are used for early loading
CPU microcode or loading ACPI table overrides.

Install hooks can install files to this archive by adding them to _$EARLYROOT_.

== About runtime hooks

Runtime hooks added to the image via the *add_runscript* function from an
install hook are able to provide extra functionality during early userspace.
Specific functions in these files will run at different times. A hook can
define one or more of these. At each hook point, hooks are run in the order
that they are defined in the HOOKS variable, except for cleanup hooks which are
run in reverse.

*run_earlyhook*::
    Functions of this name will be run once the API mounts have been setup and
    the kernel command line has been parsed. Daemons needed for early userspace
    should be started from this hook point.

*run_hook*::
    Functions of this name will be run after any early hooks, and after user
    defined modules have been installed. This is the most common hook point, and
    functionality such as scanning for LVM volumes and mapping encrypted volumes
    should be performed here.

*run_latehook*::
    Functions of this name will be run after root has been mounted. This is
    generally used for further necessary setup in the real root, such as
    mounting other system partitions.

*run_cleanuphook*::
    Functions of this name are run as late as possible. Any daemons started
    from a *run_earlyhook* function should be shut down here in preparation for
    switching to the real root.

*run_emergencyhook*::
    Functions of this name are run before the emergency shell launched in case
    of boot failure. For example this allows boot splash screens to terminate
    their process, so users will notice the failure.

*getarg* _argument_ [ _default_ ]::
    This function can be used in runtime hooks to get an argument from the
    kernel cmdline. If _argument_ exists with a value, the value is returned. If
    _argument_ exists without a value, _y_ is returned. If _argument_ does not
    exist, _default_ is returned. If _default_ is not specified, nothing is
    returned.

== About post hooks

Post hooks are executables or scripts executed after successful image generation for 
further processing, like signing. When *kernel-install*(8) invokes mkinitcpio, post 
hooks are disabled.

They receive the kernel as the first argument, the image as second and
optionally the unified kernel image as a third.

Note: If mkinitcpio is invoked with *-k* _none_ or *-k* _version_ and the kernel image 
is not found, the first argument will be empty.

The following environment variables are passed:

*KERNELVERSION*::
    Contains the full version of the kernel the image has been built from.

*KERNELDESTINATION*::
    The default location where the kernel should be located for booting. This
    usually is the same as the first argument but might differ if mkinitcpio has
    not been invoked with *-k* _/boot/*_. If no kernel image has been found this
    variable will be empty as well.

== Early init environment

mkinitcpio gives special treatment to certain environment variables passed on
the kernel command line:

*break*[=__<premount|postmount>__]::
    If specified, mkinitcpio will start a shell during early init. The optional
    parameter controls when this occurs: when _premount_ or no parameter are
    specified, the shell will be launched prior to mounting root. If _postmount_
    is specified, the shell will be launched after mounting root.

**disablehooks=**__hooklist__::
    This is a comma separated list of hooks which will be skipped during early
    init.

**earlymodules=**__modulelist__::
    This is a comma separated list of modules which will be loaded prior to any
    others. This is generally not needed, and usually points to a configuration
    or kernel problem.

*quiet*::
    Causes mkinitcpio to output fewer messages during boot. Errors will not be
    suppressed.

*ro*::
    Specifies that root should be mounted with readonly permissions. This is the
    default behavior.

*rw*::
    Specifies that root should be mounted with readwrite permissions. This is
    generally only useful if your initramfs uses the _fsck_ hook.

**root=**__rootdevice__::
    This variable describes the root partition which early init will mount
    before passing control to the real init. mkinitcpio understands a variety of
    formats, the most basic of which is the path to the block device, either
    directly such as _/dev/sda2_, or using a udev symlink such as
    _/dev/disk/by-label/CorsairF80-root_. Support for identification by LABEL or
    UUID tags are also supported, such as, _LABEL=CorsairF80-root_. As of
    util-linux 2.22, PARTUUID and PARTLABEL are also supported. Identification
    via hex encoded major/minor device ID is supported for legacy reasons, but
    should be avoided as it tends to be fragile.

*rootdelay*[=__seconds__]::
    Sets the delay, in seconds, that mkinitcpio is willing to wait for the root
    device to show up, if it is not available immediately. This defaults to _10_
    seconds. If an invalid integer is passed, this variable will have no effect.

**rootflags=**__flaglist__::
    A comma-separated list of flags which will be passed onto the *mount*(8)
    command when mounting the root file system. Acceptable values are file
    system specific.

**rootfstype=**__fstype__::
    Overrides the type of file system being mounted as root. This should almost
    never be needed as *mount*(8) usually detects this on its own.

*rd.debug*::
    Enables shell debug (xtrace). If _rd.log_ is not also a parameter on the
    kernel command line, this parameter implies _rd.log=console_.

**rd.log**[__=<console|file|kmsg|all>__]::
    Enables logging of early userspace messages. If specified, the optional
    parameter describes where this information is logged. Multiple options can
    be **OR**-d together using the pipe (|) character. Messages are always
    logged to the console unless the _quiet_ parameter is passed. If the
    optional parameter is not specified, _kmsg|console_ is assumed. If _rd.log_
    is not present on the kernel command line, no logging will take place. +
    *console*;;
        Writes output to _/dev/console_.
    *file*;;
        Writes output to _/run/initramfs/init.log_.
    *kmsg*;;
        Writes output to the _/dev/kmsg_ device (introduced in Linux 3.5). This
        option is a no-op if your kernel lacks support for _/dev/kmsg_.
    *all*;;
        Writes output to all known log targets.

These are only the variables that the core of mkinitcpio honor. Additional
hooks may look for other environment variables and should be documented by the
help output for the hook.

== Reproducibility

mkinitcpio aims to create reproducible initramfs images by default.

This means that two subsequent runs of mkinitcpio should produce two files
that are identical at the binary level.

Timestamps within the initramfs are set to the Unix epoch of 1970-01-01.

Note that in order for the build to be fully reproducible, the compressor
specified (e.g. gzip, xz) must also produce reproducible archives. At the time
of writing, as an inexhaustive example, the lzop compressor is incapable of
producing reproducible archives due to the insertion of a runtime timestamp.

More information can be found at https://reproducible-builds.org.
